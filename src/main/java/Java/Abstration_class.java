      Abstraction in Java is the process of showing only essential features of an 
      object while hiding its internal implementation details from the user.

      Purpose of Abstraction in Java:
      To reduce complexity by hiding unnecessary details.
      To show only important functionalities to the user.
      To improve security by restricting access to the internal code.
      To make the system easier to use, modify, and maintain.
