    /*
          
    Method Overriding (Simple Definition):
    When a child class rewrites a method of the parent class using the same name and same parameters, it is called method overriding.

    Purpose
    The purpose of method overriding is to change the behavior of a method from the parent class to fit the needs of the child class.
