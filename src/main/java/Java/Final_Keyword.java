   /*
    
    Definition of final:
    The final keyword means that once we assign a value, we cannot change it later

    Purpose of final:
    We use final keyword to make a variable constant, prevent a method from being overridden, or stop a class from being inherited.

    Easy examples to imagine:
    Final variable: Once you give it a value, you can't change it. (Like your birthdate â€” it never changes.)
    Final method: No one can modify its behavior in child classes.
    Final class: No one can make a subclass (child class) from it.
