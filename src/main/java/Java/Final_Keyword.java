   /*
    
    Definition of final:
    The final keyword means something cannot be changed after it is set.

    Purpose of final:
    We use final to make a variable constant, prevent a method from being overridden, or stop a class from being inherited.

    Easy examples to imagine:

    Final variable: Once you give it a value, you can't change it. (Like your birthdate â€” it never changes.)

    Final method: No one can modify its behavior in child classes.

    Final class: No one can make a subclass (child class) from it.
