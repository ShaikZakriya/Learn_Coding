/*
 
WebDriver in Selenium is like a remote control for your web browser.
You write instructions in your code, and WebDriver makes the browser follow those instructions
like opening a website, clicking buttons, or filling out forms.

The driver in Selenium is like a helper that lets your code talk to the browser.
For example, if you want to open Chrome using your code, you use ChromeDriver. 
It knows how to open Chrome and control it.

New ChromeDriver is the latest helper that lets your code control the Chrome browser.
It works with the new version of Chrome and helps open websites, click things, and do stuff on the browser automatically.
