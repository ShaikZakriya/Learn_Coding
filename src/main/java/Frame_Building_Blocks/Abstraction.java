/*
 
 Abstraction is nothing but hiding the code. in java we can achieve abstraction by two ways
 
 1.Abstract class
 2.Interface class
 
 In Abstact class we can hide (0 to 100% )
 In Interface class we can hide(100% of code) 
 
 Abstact class
 
 We need to use keyword called abstract when creating a class 
 
 1.Abstract class contains both 
  
   Implemented methods (with code)
   Unimplemeted methods (without any code)
   
   In order to implement the Unimplemented method we extend the abstract class and implement there
   and we can only extend one abstract class.
