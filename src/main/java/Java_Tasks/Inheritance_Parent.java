    /*
       
       Inheritance:
       Inheritance in Java means one class (child) can take features (like variables and methods) from another class (parent). 
       So, the child class doesn’t need to write the same code again — it can directly use the parent class’s code.

       Purpose:
       Inheritance helps in reusing code, saving time, and making programs easier to manage. 
       It also helps in building a relationship between classes.
