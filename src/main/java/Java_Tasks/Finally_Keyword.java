     /*
      
      Definition of finally:
      The finally keyword is used in exception handling to create a block of code that always runs, 
      no matter what happens (whether an error occurs or not).

      Purpose of finally:
      We use finally to write important code that must be executed, like closing a file, releasing memory, 
      or closing a database connection â€” even if an error happens.

      Simple idea:
      Try-catch block may or may not run fully, but finally block always runs.
